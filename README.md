# Task Manager App

This is a simple Task Manager app built with React Native using Expo. The app allows users to add tasks, mark them as complete, delete tasks, and assign urgency levels (High, Medium, Low) to each task.

## Features
- **Add Task**: Users can add new tasks with a description and urgency level (High, Medium, Low).
- **Mark Task as Complete**: Users can toggle tasks between complete and incomplete.
- **Delete Task**: Users can remove tasks from the list.
- **Task List**: Displays all tasks with clear distinctions for completed and incomplete tasks. Urgency levels are color-coded (High: Red, Medium: Yellow, Low: Green) for better visibility.
